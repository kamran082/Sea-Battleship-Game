# Data Model
I used 4 rows , 4 column board map. and randomly 2 ships will be on board map . I selected 8 bullets. and if you hit a ship you get one extra bullet. I also define yes/no function if player want to play again.

# Testing

I have manually tested this project by doing the folling:
- passed the code throught a PEP8 linter and confirmed ther are no problems.
- Given invalid inputs, strings when numbers are expected, same input twice.

# Bugs.
#Solved Bugs:

 when i wrote the project i was getting whitespace error, which i fixed it by change the setting in gitpod. No more bugs in code.

# Deployment
This project was deployed using code institute mock terminal for Heroku.

#Steps for Deployment:

1. Fore or clone this repository
2. Create a new Heroku app
3. Set the buildbacks to python and node js in the order
4. Link the Heroku app to the repository
5. Click on Deploy.

# Credits
- Code institute for the deployment terminal
- I have taken few lines from code instituete README file.
- I searched google to get help to understand few codes concepts.
